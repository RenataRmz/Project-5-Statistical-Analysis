# Project-5-Statistical-Analysis

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to practice statistical analysis using the iterative data analysis process. For this project, you will use a Housing Prices dataset.  The goal of the analysis is to identify the most important features of houses that affect the sale prices.

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Try to apply everything you have learned so far about data analysis (in creative ways if you can) such as data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and various statistical analysis methods.
 - Apply the iterative data analysis process -- setting expectations, collecting information, and reacting to data / revising expectations.
 - Conduct your analysis in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other Python libraries you have learned, as necessary.
 
## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

- **A Jupyter notebook** (statistical-analysis.ipynb) containing your Python codes, outputs, and data visualizations. Make sure to include explanations for each of your steps in Markdown cells or Python comments.
- **A data folder** containing your data set.


This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
